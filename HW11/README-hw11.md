# Nelson's HW11 Stuff
For the first part of the assignment, see either:
- `plot_wavefunctionsHW11.m`
- `HW11_2.m`
  
`plot_wavefunctionsHW11.m` plots the sinusodials solution to the one-dimensional Scrodinger equation for the PIB for various values of k as described in HW11. `HW11_2.m` is a generalized version of the same program that lets you start at any n-value, and plots the 9 following n values, for a total of 10 plots.

For the second part of the assignment, I used `HW11_2.m` to find the next values such that *k* satisfied the boundary conditions.

For the third part of the assignment, I made the function `psi_l.m` to plot *k* as a continuous variable. There are no `x`'s in `psi_l.m`, as the plot is for when *x=L*.
