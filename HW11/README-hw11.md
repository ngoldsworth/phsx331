For the first part of the assignment, see either:

  -plot_wavefunctionsHW11.m
  
  -HW11_2.m
  
'plot_wavefunctionsHW11.m' plots the sinusodials solution to the one-dimensional Scrodinger equation for the PIB for various values of k as described in HW11. 'HW11_2.m' is a generalized version of the same program that lets you start at any n-value, and plots the 9 following n values, for a total of 10 plots.
